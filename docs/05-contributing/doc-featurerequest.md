# Feature Requests

## Introduction

We welcome and appreciate suggestions for new features and improvements to Megabots. Your ideas can help us enhance the project and make it more useful to the community. This document outlines the process for submitting a feature request.

## How to Submit a Feature Request

1. **Search for existing feature requests**: Before submitting a new feature request, please check the existing issues and feature requests on our GitHub repository to ensure your idea hasn't been proposed already. If it has, you can add your support by commenting or reacting to the existing issue.

2. **Open a new issue**: If your idea hasn't been proposed yet, create a new issue in the GitHub repository using the "Feature Request" template. Make sure to provide all the required information and follow the template guidelines.

3. **Provide a clear and concise description**: In your feature request, describe the problem you're trying to solve or the functionality you'd like to see added. Explain why this feature is important and how it would benefit the project.

4. **Include relevant information**: Provide any relevant details, such as examples, use cases, or potential implementation ideas. This will help us better understand your proposal and evaluate its feasibility.

5. **Be patient**: Our team will review your feature request and discuss its merits. We may ask for more information or clarification, so be prepared to engage in a conversation about your proposal. Keep in mind that we may not be able to implement every feature request, and some ideas may be deferred or declined based on project priorities and resources.

## What Happens Next

Once you have submitted your feature request, our team will review and discuss it. We will consider factors such as the impact on the project, the complexity of implementation, and the availability of resources when deciding whether to move forward with the idea.

If we decide to pursue your feature request, we will add it to our development roadmap and begin working on it. You may be asked to provide additional input or assistance during the implementation process.

We appreciate your interest in improving Megabots and look forward to hearing your ideas. Together, we can make the project even better!
