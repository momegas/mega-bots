🤖 Megabots is backed by some of the most famous tools for productionalising AI. It uses [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) for managing LLM chains, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to create a production ready API, [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to create a UI. At the moment it uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to generate answers, but we plan to support other LLMs in the future.
