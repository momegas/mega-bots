# Bug Reports

## Introduction

We appreciate your help in identifying and reporting bugs in Megabots. By reporting bugs, you are making a valuable contribution to the project and helping us improve its stability and reliability. This document outlines the process for submitting a bug report.

## How to Submit a Bug Report

1. **Search for existing bug reports**: Before submitting a new bug report, please check the existing issues on our GitHub repository to ensure the bug hasn't been reported already. If it has, you can add your support by commenting or reacting to the existing issue.

2. **Open a new issue**: If the bug hasn't been reported yet, create a new issue in the GitHub repository using the "Bug Report" template. Make sure to provide all the required information and follow the template guidelines.

3. **Provide a clear and concise description**: In your bug report, describe the problem you're experiencing, including any error messages, unexpected behavior, or crashes. Explain the steps to reproduce the issue, and provide any relevant details about your environment, such as your operating system, browser, or device.

4. **Include relevant logs or screenshots**: If possible, provide logs, screenshots, or other supporting material that can help us diagnose and troubleshoot the issue. This information can be crucial in identifying the root cause of the problem.

5. **Be patient**: Our team will review your bug report and work on a fix as soon as possible. We may ask for more information or clarification, so be prepared to engage in a conversation about the issue. Keep in mind that fixing bugs can take time, and some issues may be deferred or prioritized based on project needs and resources.

## What Happens Next

Once you have submitted your bug report, our team will review it and attempt to reproduce the issue. If we can confirm the bug, we will work on a fix and include it in a future update. We may also ask for your help in testing the fix to ensure it resolves the issue.
